The -d option used in the docker run command above makes the container run in the background.
Use this command to monitor the output from the container

shell> docker logs mysql1

Once initialization is finished, the command's
output is going to contain the random password
generated for the root user; check the password with,
for example, this command:

shell> docker logs mysql1 2>&1 | grep GENERATED
GENERATED ROOT PASSWORD: Axegh3kAJyDLaRuBemecis&EShOs

shell> docker exec -it mysql1 mysql -u root -p

mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';


mysql> SELECT host FROM mysql.user WHERE User = 'root';

You will need to add the IP address of each system that you want to grant access to, and then grant privileges:

mysql> CREATE USER 'root'@'ip_address' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'ip_address';

If you see %, well then, there's another problem altogether as that is "any remote source". If however you do want any/all systems to connect via root, use the % wildcard to grant access:

msyql> CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%';

Password for root user in database of mysql CONTAINER :
